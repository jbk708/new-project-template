# Specialist Agent Pipeline

## Mission

Six agents form the development pipeline: a Planner/SWE adversarial loop reconciles every non-trivial implementation plan before code is touched, with an explicit user-approval checkpoint, followed by QA gates and a dedicated Deployer. A read-only diagnostics agent is available independently for production troubleshooting.

## The Team

| Agent | Model | Access | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`team-lead.md`](team-lead.md) | Opus | Full + dispatch | Orchestrates the pipeline; owns the final PR checklist gate |
| [`planner.md`](planner.md) | Opus | Read-only | Drafts plans; reconciles with SWE |
| [`SWE.md`](SWE.md) | Sonnet | Full | Adversarially reviews the plan, then implements it once approved |
| [`QA.md`](QA.md) | Sonnet | Full | Runs `/code-review`, full test suite, linters |
| [`deployer.md`](deployer.md) | Sonnet | Full | Ships to the target environment; owns Deploy Discipline |
| [`diagnostics.md`](diagnostics.md) | Sonnet | Read-only | Production diagnostics only, never mutates |

## Pipeline Flow

1. Team Lead triages: does this clear the trigger threshold?
2. Planner drafts a plan.
3. Planner ⇄ SWE adversarially reconcile the plan (no code written yet).
4. Team Lead surfaces the reconciled plan to the user — **hard blocking checkpoint, no implementation without explicit go-ahead.**
5. SWE implements: stubs → tests → code → `/simplify`.
6. QA runs `/code-review` → full test suite → linters.
7. Team Lead confirms the PR checklist.
8. Deployer ships, with a two-failed-attempt circuit breaker.

`diagnostics` sits outside this flow — invoke it directly whenever you need to check the live environment's actual state.

## Trigger Threshold

Single-line/typo/comment fixes skip the pipeline entirely — just make the change. Anything touching more than one file, or any file with real invariants (schemas, migrations, config, CI, deploy manifests, secrets), goes through the full Team Lead → Planner ⇄ SWE → user go-ahead → SWE implements → QA → Deployer flow.

## Adapting This Pipeline To Your Project

These agents ship generic. Before relying on them, fill in the project specifics:

- **`QA.md`** — replace the `{TEST_COMMAND}` and `{LINT_COMMANDS}` placeholders with the real commands from `README.md` Setup. Keep them identical to what CI runs.
- **`deployer.md`** — replace `{DEPLOY_COMMANDS}` with the real release path, and record the rollback procedure.
- **`diagnostics.md`** — replace `{ACCESS_PATTERN}` with how you reach the live environment, and fill the Memory section with hostnames, health endpoints, and expected service state.
- **Every agent** — the `## Memory` section is where durable, hard-won project facts accumulate. Write a fact there the first time it bites you; that is what keeps the pipeline from relearning the same footgun.
- If the project has no deploy target, delete `deployer.md` and `diagnostics.md` and drop steps 7–8 from the flow.

## Frontmatter Convention

Every agent file in this directory starts with:

```yaml
---
name: <matches filename, case-sensitive — SWE and QA are the two uppercase exceptions>
description: <written for auto-selection — what the agent does and when to invoke it>
tools: [<restricted tool list>]
model: opus | sonnet
---
```

## Guardrails

- Do not duplicate long sprint or operational history here — link to `TICKETS.md` instead.
- Do not put secrets or customer-specific data in this directory.
- Keep `CLAUDE.md` compact — durable domain memory belongs in the relevant agent file here.
